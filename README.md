Schad, Daniel J.,  Vasishth, Sven Hohenstein, and Reinhold Kliegl. (2020). How to capitalize on a priori contrasts in linear (mixed) models: A tutorial. *Journal of Memory and Language*. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jml.2019.104038

## What is the difference between this material and the original article?

- Step-by-step code presentation using [`flipbookr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/flipbookr/index.html)
- more effective, more seamless, and more understandable coding following [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)
- written in Japanese (one of the first annotations to the original article in non-English languages)
