- Step-by-step code presentation using [`flipbookr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/flipbookr/index.html)
- more effective, more seamless, and more understandable coding following [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)
  - Codes are rewritten using [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/)'s functions and [the native pipe `|>`](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-announce/2021/000670.html#:~:text=the%20new%20native%20pipe%20operator%20%22%7C%3E%22)
