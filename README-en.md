# Factor Coding

Annotations in Japanese to Schad et al (2020) to understand how to code nominal scales using R

Schad, D. J., Vasishth, S., Hohenstein, S., & Kliegl, R. (2020). How to capitalize on a priori contrasts in linear (mixed) models: A tutorial. *Journal of Memory and Language*. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jml.2019.104038

The annotations also covers the following chapters of textbooks for the psychologists/linguists who want to master statistics:

1. Vasishth, S., Schad, D., Bürki, A., & Kliegl, R. (In preparation). [*Contrast coding*](https://vasishth.github.io/Freq_CogSci/basic-concepts-illustrated-using-a-two-level-factor.html). In Vasishth, S., Schad, D., Bürki, A., & Kliegl, R. (Eds.), Linear Mixed Models in Linguistics and Psychology: A Comprehensive Introduction. https://vasishth.github.io/Freq_CogSci/basic-concepts-illustrated-using-a-two-level-factor.html
2. Nicenboim, B., Schad, D., and Vasishth, S. (In preparation). [*Contrast coding*](https://vasishth.github.io/bayescogsci/book/ch-contr.html). In Nicenboim, B., Schad, D., and Vasishth, S. (Eds.), An Introduction to Bayesian Data Analysis for Cognitive Science. https://vasishth.github.io/bayescogsci/book/ch-contr.html

## What is the difference between this material and the original article?

- Step-by-step code presentation using [`flipbookr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/flipbookr/index.html)
- more effective, more seamless, and more understandable coding following [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)
  - Codes are rewritten using [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/)'s functions and [the native pipe `|>`](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-announce/2021/000670.html#:~:text=the%20new%20native%20pipe%20operator%20%22%7C%3E%22)
- written in Japanese
  - one of the first annotations to the original article in non-English languages
